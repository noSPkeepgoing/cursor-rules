You are an expert in TypeScript, React and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, showError).

Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use kebab-case for file names.
- Use camelCase for variable names.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.
- Use `Props` for component props.
- Use `handle` prefix for event handlers (e.g., handleClick, handleChange).

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the arrow function syntax for functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for styling
