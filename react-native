Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Use styled components for styling.
- Use typescript for type checking.
- Use react native for mobile app development.
- Use "Props" for component props types.
